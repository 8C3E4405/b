  <h2>Everything is story</h2>
  <p>or fact.</p>
<p>To be accurate, stories derive from facts, <em>or are complete bullshit</em>.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalization_(psychology">rationalize</a>) and we create stories from facts.</p>
<p>Facts are concrete and there is tangible proof.
Everything which can't be proved is not a fact.</p>
<p>Sometimes, stories become facts as Ryan Holiday says in <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/Trust-Me-Lying-Confessions-Manipulator/dp/1591846285">Trust me I'm lying</a> (From memory)</p>
<blockquote><p>If  you have a story in a well know newspaper. Then you can us it as a reference in Wikipedia. And Wikipedia is the truth, so it becomes the truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because newspapers don't fact check (except <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/08/29/kevin-kelly/">Wired</a> and me).</p>
<p>From any fact, you can create a story.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘You run ahead? Are you doing it as a shepherd? Or as an exception? A third case would be the fugitive. First question of conscience.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fridrich Nietszche - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Twilight-Idols-Friedrich-Nietzsche/dp/1479131679">Twilight of the Idols</a></p>
<p>The same concept explained by <a href="https://www.google.fr/search?q=what+society+thinks+what+i+think&amp;tbm=isch">GIFs</a></p>
<p>If you do something, you can say anything to justify it. That's Lawyer's work.</p>
<p>Why? To help us remember? To be able to tell it? To look good? To be fun? I don't know.</p>
<p>How to understand history? Understand historians.</p>
<p>History is a story, 
personal development is a story,<br>
life is a story.</p>
<p>We can say what we want, as long as we are credible. Which means that we either tell the truth or are a good actor.</p>
