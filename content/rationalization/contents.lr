body:

Society wants us to be rational.

Do you really know someone who is rational? No, *you just got to dig deep enough*.

We rationalize, that is telling the story of our life. 

This can be can be an happy, sad or rationale story.

We are not rational, we make ourselves rationale.

Even though, we still need to do some marketing.
